        <h2>What’s the Issue? Deforestation</h2>
        <p>
            Deforestation is the large-scale removal of trees which leads to the destruction of forests. 
            This issue affects ecosystems and humans by contributing to climate change, biodiversity loss, and soil degradation.
        </p>

        <h3>Causes of Deforestation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Urban Construction:</strong> Forests are cleared for the expansion of urban areas, including roads, bridges, and power plants, resulting in significant loss of forest life. (PhilCHM)</li>
            <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Conversion of forest into agricultural land, including slash-and-burn farming (kaingin) commonly practiced in the Philippines. (PhilCHM)</li>
            <li><strong>Use for Fuel:</strong> Trees are cut down to be used as firewood or turned into charcoal for cooking and heating, especially in rural areas. (PhilCHM)</li>
            <li><strong>Commercial Purposes:</strong> Forests are cleared for oil and mining exploitation, often exacerbated by human-induced fires. (PhilCHM)</li>
            <li><strong>Illegal Logging:</strong> Both legal and illegal logging activities contribute to deforestation, depriving wildlife of their habitat. (PhilCHM)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Effects of Deforestation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Erosion:</strong> Loss of nutrients from soil leads to dry, infertile land and further environmental degradation. (PhilCHM)</li>
            <li><strong>Disruption of Water Cycle:</strong> Trees help regulate water absorption and release. Deforestation leads to imbalances in the ecosystem’s water cycle. (PhilCHM)</li>
            <li><strong>Flooding and Drought:</strong> Without trees to absorb excess water, periods of flood and drought become more frequent, increasing risks for nearby communities. (PhilCHM)</li>
            <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Trees store carbon dioxide. When forests are destroyed, the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change. (PhilCHM)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Definition of Deforestation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The clearing or thinning of forest by humans. (Britannica)</li>
            <li>The removal and destruction of forests or stands of trees from land, later converted to non-forest use. (Wikipedia)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Current Status of Deforestation in the Philippines</h3>
        <p>
            In the Philippines, from 2001 to 2022, a total of 1.42 million hectares of tree cover was lost, representing a 7.6% decrease of the country's total tree cover of approximately 18.684 million hectares. (Climate Change Commission)
        </p>
        <p>
            From 2002 to 2023, the Philippines lost 190,000 hectares (190 kha) of humid primary forest, which accounts for 13% of its total tree cover loss. During the same period, the total area of humid primary forest decreased by 4.1%. (Global Forest Watch)
